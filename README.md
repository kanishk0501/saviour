## Implementation
We plan to make a pendant wearable which is going to have electrodes and the ecg sensor to predict heart attacks accurately, moreover, we planned to create a hospital-end of the portal where the emergency services can access the location of the patient from the SOS signal, we also plan to create an app. This app will be accessed by the patient and the ambulance driver for easy communication of the location, so that there is less delay for the emergency services to reach the patients.
